Hi! I am a fourth year undergraduate at the University of Washington majoring in physics and astronomy. My current research explores the possibility of detecting binary systems containing a compact object by searching for self-lensing signatures. My other research interests include high-energy and stellar astrophysics. I currently serve as an officer for the Women+ in Physics Club at UW, and in my free time I enjoy painting and playing water polo.
